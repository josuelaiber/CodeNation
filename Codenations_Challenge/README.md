This challenge was done to get the scholarship for the CodeNation's AceleraDev course. The challenge was  to predict the math score of the people who took the ENEM in 2016. Enem is similar to the Abitur (Germany) or the SAT (USA).

To get the scholarship, a score above 90% was required when sending the result on the CodeNation's website. With this code, I got 90.73%.

Not all the feature engineering has been done, nor all the tests I would like, for lack of time. Even so, success was achieved.
